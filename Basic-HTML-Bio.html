<p>My name is Ben Snyder. I'm an aspiring data scientist looking to grow my skills.
   I have a background in C++ and Java, and have a Bachelor's degree in Communications Media.
   I live in Akron with my fiancee, Emily, and have a crazy cat named Winston.</p><br>

   <p>I like to consider myself a fun-loving guy. I enjoy hiking, working out, and games.
     I've recently started getting into board games. There are a bunch of unique games out there
     right now, but unfortunately nobody can come over and play right now. :(
